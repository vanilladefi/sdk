Vanilla SDK is a Typescript library that should everything you need to interface with Vanilla smart contracts, whether it's v1.0, v1.1 or the upcoming v2.0.

We use the Vanilla SDK to power our own frontends. You too can use the SDK to build your own frontend, interface with or create trading bots, et cetera!
